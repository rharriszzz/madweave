    <h2>Handbook of Triaxial Weaves<small> - A Guide to HexWeave and MadWeave, by Elizabeth Harris and Charlene St. John</small></h2>
<p>This is a comprehensive book on triaxial weaving.  It includes a pattern library, quick start projects with each topic, and a small interactive computer program.  It is suitable for both individual study and classes or workshops.

<p>Of interest to a range of crafters: off-loom and on-loom weavers, basket makers, and quilters,
as well as artists working in paper crafts, and mosaic tilling. I also think that teachers could use
mad weave as a way to illustrate simple geometric concepts.

<p>This book will be published by <a
